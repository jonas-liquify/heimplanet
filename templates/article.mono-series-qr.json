However, in the spirit of getting the most out of your equipment we do want to give some tips on how to do so. \n<br><br>\n<b>Overloading / Overfilling</b>: <br>While all the bag's features are highly durable, overloading or overfilling your bag can put a strain on handles, seams and zippers and potentially reduce their lifespan. Simply pack mindfully and your bag will function even longer.\n\n<br><br>\n<b>Direct sunlight</b>: <br> Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause fading and weaken the material over time. This of course doesnt mean that you can't travel so sunny places! Just if you are resting and you have the chance place your gear in the shade - your bag will thank you for it. \n<br><br>\n<b>Handling</b>:<br>Handle your bag with clean hands to avoid transferring oils and dirt. Be cautious with sharp objects to prevent scratches or tears.",

            "textarea_text": "<b>DO THIS </b> \n<br><br>\n\nCleaning: Regularly wipe your bag with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust. For deeper cleaning, use a damp cloth with mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the material. Alternatively, you can rinse the completely empty bag using a handheld showerhead or a gentle stream of lukewarm water in the shower or bathtub. After rinsing, ensure the bag is thoroughly dried by allowing it to air dry completely before using or storing it.\nFoto\n<br><br>\nStorage: Store your bag in a dust bag or pillowcase to protect it from dust and light. Stuff the bag with tissue paper to maintain its shape, and avoid hanging it, which can distort its form.\nFoto?\n\n<br><br>\nEnhancing and Maintaining Water Resistance: Textiles can gradually lose their water-repellent properties due to regular use and cleaning. To restore and maintain your bag's ability to repel water, consider using a PFAS-free water-repellent spray. These sprays offer safe and effective protection without harmful chemicals. Before applying, ensure the bag is clean and dry, then spray evenly across the surface and allow it to dry fully.\n<br><br>\nPlease note that your bag's internal coating is designed to be water-resistant, ensuring that the contents stay dry even if the external water repellency diminishes. While the outer fabric might stop repelling water as effectively, the inner coating will prevent water from penetrating the bag, keeping your belongings safe and dry.\n\n<br><br>\n<b>AVOID THIS</b><br><br>\nWashing Machine and Dryer: Never put your bag in the washing machine or dryer, as this can cause irreparable damage.\nIcon\n\nIroning: Avoid ironing your bag, as the heat can warp or melt the material, especially for synthetic fabrics.\nIcon\n\n\nContact with Water: Keep your bag away from excessive moisture, which can damage both the exterior and interior, even if water-resistant.\n\nUsing Harsh Cleaners: Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the fabric.\n\nImproper Storage: Don’t store your bag in damp, unventilated areas, as this can lead to mold and odors.",
