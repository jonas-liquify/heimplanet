Simply pack mindfully and your bag will function even longer.\n\n<br><br>\n<b>Direct sunlight</b>: <br> Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause fading and weaken the material over time. This of course doesnt mean that you can't travel so sunny places! Just if you are resting and you have the chance place your gear in the shade - your bag will thank you for it. \n<br><br>\n<b>Handling</b>:<br>Handle your bag with clean hands to avoid transferring oils and dirt.

For deeper cleaning, use a damp cloth with mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals. Alternatively, rinse the empty bag with lukewarm water using a gentle showerhead. Let it air dry completely before use or storage.\n<br><br>\n\n<b>Storage:</b><br>Keep your bag in a dust bag or pillowcase to protect from dust and light. Stuff it with tissue paper to maintain its shape, and avoid hanging, which can distort the form.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>Water Resistance Maintenance:</b><br>Over time, textiles may lose their water-repellent properties. Restore this by applying a PFAS-free water-repellent spray to a clean, dry bag. Allow it to dry fully. The internal coating is water-resistant, protecting contents even if the exterior loses some repellency.\n\n<br><br>\n<b>AVOID THIS</b><br><br>\n<b>No washing machine/dryer:</b> it can cause permanent damage.\n<br>\n<b>No ironing:</b> Heat can warp or melt synthetic fabrics.\n<br>\n<b>Excess Moisture:</b> Excessive water exposure can damage the exterior and interior.\n<br>\n<b>No harsh cleaners:</b> Avoid abrasive or chemical cleaners.\n<br>\n<b>Improper Storage:</b> Do not store in damp or unventilated spaces, which can cause mold and odors.",
